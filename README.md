# pcap-parser
A basic parser for dns and http requests for the Foundations of Networks and Mobile Systems class at NYU 

We are using the command line version of wireshark, which is called tshark

Here is how you run the parsing scripts for dns and http objects:
python dns-parser [pcap file]
python http-parser [pcap file]

Both of the scripts show very basic information about the dns and http objects. You can update the scripts based on what you need.
